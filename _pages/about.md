I am a mathematician developing novel applications of algebraic topology to data science. I use techniques from topology to infer structural information from data, particularly data arising from biology and neuroscience experiments. I am currently an assistant professor of mathematics at <a href="https://www.swarthmore.edu/mathematics-statistics">Swarthmore College</a> (on leave from <a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/">Wesleyan University</a> 2025-2026). I received my PhD in <a href="https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/">Applied Mathematics and Computational Science</a> from the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/"> Robert Ghrist</a>.
